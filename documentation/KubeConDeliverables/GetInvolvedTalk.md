# How to Get Involved in CNCF Environmental Sustainability TAG

<!-- the following is from the TAG proposal -->
In September of 2022, the Environmental Sustainability Technical Advisory Group (TAG) was created within the CNCF.  The charter was worked on by many members of the community with passion for minimizing carbon consumption.  The TAG was created to advocate, develop, support, and help evaluate environmental sustainability initiatives within cloud native technologies. 

Hear from the TAG co-chairs as they present to the CNCF community the TAG's charter and scope, introduce ongoing and planned initiatives, and answer questions from the community.

In this session, we will discuss the in detail the goals of the TAG, share how it will identify values and incentives for service providers to reduce their consumption and carbon footprint through cloud native tooling, and discuss how you can become involved.
