# Environmental Sustainability TAG Proposal

## Sig Mission Statement

### Why Sustainability? 

Data Centers, and therefore every compute resource accessible, are currently using 2% of the world's energy. This is conservatively expected to grow to hold 1-2% in the next couple of years, up to 12% by 2040. The growth in energy for computing is out-pacing the global growth in energy production. The contributing factors include explosion in data, emergence of energy-intensive workloads such as AI and, the flattening of Moore's law. The energy consumption of data centers is therefore causing half of the Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of countries like Germany or Japan. GHG emissions are one of the key factors for global warming. In order to curb this trend, we should immediately start looking for ways to reduce the environmental footprints of increasingly large data centers. The good news is that there is also an increase in industry initiatives for environmental sustainability. This working group was formed to advocate for, develop, support, and help evaluate environmental sustainability initiatives.  

All activities should positively impact the community by changing mindset, increasing efficiency, and putting sustainability on everyone's agenda.  We also seek to prevent greenwashing.

Making sustainability more accessible is essential in this work.  Customers want to use fewer resources for both environmental and for financial reasons, but there is limited direction in how and much of the technology is within the early stages.  Balancing resource consumption with desire for performance is also difficult.  Much of the tooling is scattered and not tested.

We want projects that cover more material, such as:
Standards:  The Green Software Foundation has the Software Carbon Intensity Specification which is appealing:  
Tooling for test, evaluation, and audit (little exists at present)
Ways to do measurement within systems (Scaphandre)

## Responsibilities & Deliverables

### Responsibilities

- users/personas/needs/customer demands in the power metrics/measurements/management
- identifications of areas of focus on performance per Watt, power savings, etc
- methodology, tools, framework for evaluation - how do products and tools fit the users in the area?
- architecture evaluations - what power measurement and management as well as performance gaps are there?
- work on integrating common tooling into different projects, particularly where that tooling is a CNCF project 
- define procedures to improve environmental sustainability factors, develop benchmarks for the quantification of energy consumption of software, develop techniques to manage software such that the overall energy consumption and associated carbon is reduced.

### Deliverables to ToC

- framework document for the cloud-native power metrics/measurements/management space
- landscape for the power metrics/measurements/management savings
- recommendations for sandbox projects where exploration is needed
- recommendations for new CNCF projects where there is clear use cases
- scheduled regular reporting to ToC on ongoing and completed work
- reporting on power saving projects for graduation and other events, summarizing the external power related reviews and other relevant information
- help with regular health checks of projects in the category

#### Audiences

- Education - audience is end users and developers
- Project intelligence - audience is TOC / TOC Community
- Who else?

#### The issue of the Landscape(s)

- Being “deliberate” about what this (these) are for, and for whom?
- Main landscape has become an anti-pattern (kitchen sink effect)

#### Execution & Focus

- How do we spell out CNCF “work items” that can be executed by both CNCF staff and the TOC community
- Can the TOC ask questions of the SIGs?  “Go ruminate on this please”
- Making sure recommendations don’t over-determine users’ tech choices.  The storage WG was successful because it provided genuine guidance about a *range* of approaches, in a way that is transparent, unbiased, actionable
